Drift Simulation in R for two epistatic traits at four loci
==========================================================

Rough R script for genetic drift simulation two trait, four locus population change in ecotypes of highly-selfing, diploidized tetraploid, A. barbata. Warning: Mendelian processes do not lend themselves well to vectorizing for random samples, hence all the "for" loops. Specify popsize, outcrossing rate, and number of generations to run.

Also, this is a quick and dirty sandbox script - improvements to follow. Plots to follow.
